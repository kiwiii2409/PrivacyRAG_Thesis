\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:introduction}

% introduce using LLMs and integration with database for RAG. Crucial architecture for building knowledgeable and grouded AI systems. reduces hallucinations and allows for most recent knowledge


% Major problem:  privacy utility tradeoff. rag enhances factual accuracy but risks leaking sensitive informatino from the knowlege base. significant privacy risk

% exisitng work handles this using synthetic data, differential privacy or (industry) prompt based defenses (anthopic aws). Often focussed on single document leakage and fail to address cross-document leakage. current method either don't conisder the risk of aggreagtion of quasi-identifiers or over-redact it, degrading utility

% thesis proposes a new method called selective anonymization to tackle single as well as cross-document leakage using minimal redactions to preserve as much utility as possible

% we begin with the relevant bakcground information and commonly used taxonom in c2, c3 will have a lit review about comon attack and defensive methods against rag. c4 will have our proposed method and c5 will evaluate. c6 discusses limiations and future work
